# QuizMaker

It's a simple personal project just to help me and my friends to create quizes to study at Uni.

I'm scrapping pdf's to get questions data and add them directly to database as .json. In most cases it's diffcult to get correct answers from scrapping(due to different kinds of marking correct answers) so you need complete whole quiz and edit data here(if you don't have access to database).

Depending on the pdf, it is very possible that you will need to modify the scrapping algorithm.

Hosting is via firebase hosting.

Database is firebase firestore.
